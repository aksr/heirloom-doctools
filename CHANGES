    Very old versions of the mm macros inserted cut marks in the
    document for typesetters which had used endless paper rolls.
    Although they are only of historical significance they had
    never been removed in the Solaris version of mm.  They are
    now switched of (via .rm )k).

    Bugfix by Steffen Nurpmeso: In .rm code a function return
    value is unchecked used as a pointer.

    eqn(1) did not compile because of bison to BSD yacc differ-
    ences.  Sorry, had not tested on Linux this time...

    Experimental bugfix: When .bp is directly followed by .. and
    .bp triggers a macro which calls a macro then document text
    is printed at that trap position.  This bug is also in other
    ditroff derivatives (e.g. DWB and Plan9).  It is difficult to
    track the bug to it's root cause so it is an experimental fix
    at the moment.

    \fP after \fS did set the font before the previous font and
    not the previous one.

    Bug reported by Pierre-Jean Fichet fixed: If character "!" is
    used in a .char request it did not work in a .if request as
    the NOT operator.

    The eqn parser used type int for all token values--even
    pointers.  This may work fine on 32 bit hardware but causes
    problems on 64 bit.  A new data type had been introduced to
    separate int tokens from pointers.

    Also a bug in the parser regarding movements (e.g. FWD) had
    been fixed.

    A variable had been initilized after use.  This variable mi-
    nus a literal value is used as an array index.  When data
    from the array is read an invalid memory segment is accessed.
    This had caused crashes on at least OpenBSD.
