2015-02-27
    tbl:  Option -Tlocale added which (in an UTF-8 locale) en-
    ables output of table lines with Unicode glyphs.

2015-02-26
    Bugfix: The zero width flag (set e.g. by \z or \L) did not
    work for Unicode characters.  As a consequence e.g. \L could
    not be used width \U'2551' to draw a double vertical line.

2015-02-18
    Bugfix: When there were several .ft requests to not mounted
    fonts in short succession the output was wrong.

2015-02-12
    Read-only register .S added for DWB compatibility.

2014-12-23
    mdoc: Footer had not been displayed if page length was
    reached.

Release 141217
==============

2014-12-16
    mdoc updated for processing up-to-date manpages.  Still much
    work needs to be done on mdoc.

    nroff: Special character names of arbitrary length are now
    possible.

    nroff: Many special characters to -Tlp and -Tlocale (UTF-8)
    added.

2014-12-15
    nroff: Compiled in "tab.lp" and "tab.utf8" removed.  The
    "nterm" directory is now required for nroff (at least with
    file "tab.lp" or "tab.utf8").

2014-12-13
    Macro 'lsm' and number registers 'lsn' and 'lss' added.

2014-12-05
    Bugfix: .unformat: \e gets restored now.

2014-11-06
    Distingtion between BSD and non-BSD manuals removed (Anthony
    J. Bentley).

    pic, tbl, eqn: Allow whitespace between '.' and PS, PE, PF,
    TS, TE, EQ, EN.

2014-11-05
    With command line option '-rcR=1' -man manpages are displayed
    as one large single page.

Release 141029
==============

2014-10-29
    Documentation revised by Pierre-Jean Fichet:  doc/fonts/
    changed to use free available OTF fonts.

2014-10-27
    col(1) bugfix: Avoid to access chars before string.

    troff: fdprintf changed back to libc fprintf.

    troff: 32 bit bug in register and macro allocation fixed (Bug
    reported by Anthony J. Bentley).

    nroff/troff made -Wall clean.

2014-10-22
    OpenSolaris col(1) added.

2014-10-06
    Drawing of filled polygon (\D'P ...'), filled circle (\D'C
    ...') and filled ellipse (\D'E ...') added.

2014-09-21
    *roff: Option -V for version information added.

2014-09-14
    Any version of roff (e.g. UNIX V7) does count \} as a macro
    argument regarding \n(.$.  This makes \n(.$ rather random if
    you cannot force users to put \} on a separate line *or* to
    put it behind the macro call and substract 1 from \n(.$.  To
    make \n(.$ meaningful again this bug has been fixed now, i.e.
    \} is not considered as a macro argument anymore.

2014-09-07
    Documentation revised by Pierre-Jean Fichet:  doc/just/ and
    doc/quickstart/ changed to use free available OTF fonts.

2014-09-03
    Bug reported by Pierre-Jean Fichet fixed:  If character '"'
    is used in a .char request it did not work in a .if request
    as the string compare delimiter.

2014-08-28
    Bug reported by Blake McBride fixed:  Very old versions of
    the mm macros inserted cut marks in the document for
    typesetters which had used endless paper rolls.  Although
    they are only of historical significance they had never been
    removed in the Solaris version of mm.  They are now switched
    of (via .rm )k).

2014-08-23
    Bugfix by Steffen Nurpmeso:  In .rm code a function return
    value is unchecked used as a pointer.

2014-08-20
    eqn(1) did not compile because of bison to BSD yacc differ-
    ences.  Sorry, had not tested on Linux this time...

2014-08-18
    Experimental bugfix: When .bp is directly followed by .. and
    .bp triggers a macro which calls a macro then document text
    is printed at that trap position.  This bug is also in other
    ditroff derivatives (e.g. DWB and Plan9).  It is difficult to
    track the bug to it's root cause so it is an experimental fix
    at the moment.

2014-08-17
    \fP after \fS did set the font before the previous font and
    not the previous one.

2014-08-16
    Bug reported by Pierre-Jean Fichet fixed:  If character "!"
    is used in a .char request it did not work in a .if request
    as the NOT operator.

2014-08-14
    The eqn parser used type int for all token values--even
    pointers.  This may work fine on 32 bit hardware but causes
    problems on 64 bit.  A new data type had been introduced to
    separate int tokens from pointers.

    Also a bug in the parser regarding movements (e.g. FWD) had
    been fixed.

2014-07-27
    A variable had been initilized after use.  This variable
    minus a literal value is used as an array index.  When data
    from the array is read an invalid memory segment is accessed.
    This had caused crashes on at least OpenBSD.
